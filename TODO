[] redo nosql schema, users-> days, habits, etc.
    could have everything grow from user objects?

[] seperate backend from front end:
    all frontend pieces should just expect a list of habits or days or whatever, all the database calls should be done in a seperate
    functions file. the real test is: can I switch easily between aws and firebase?

[] use react suite for all style!

[] if continuing to use firebase, need to rework the database structure to include users
